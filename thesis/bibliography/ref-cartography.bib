abstract = {Roads are essential component of topographic maps and spatial databases. The challenge in automated generalisation of road networks is to derive a connected network while maintaining the structure for the intended target scale and to achieve this with minimum user intervention. A lot of methods to select, displace and simplify roads have been presented; the focus here is on the generalisation of networks using visual perception techniques. This paper presents a framework based on visual perception that uses minimum attributes for generalisation of both `rural' and `urban' roads over large scale change. The system incorporated graph theoretic techniques to explicitly model the topology of the network as it was generalized. The model uses a fine scale map (1:1250 or 1:2500) as input and generates small scale (1:250,000) maps directly from it without creating intermediate small scale maps. The results compared favorably with paper maps (Ordnance Surveys Stratgie dataset (1:250,000)).},

abstract = {The straight skeleton of a polygon is a variant of the medial axis introduced by Aichholzer et al., defined by a shrinking process in which each edge of the polygon moves inward at a fixed rate. We construct the straight skeleton of an n -gon with r reflex vertices in time O(n 1+$\varepsilon$ + n 8/11+$\varepsilon$ r 9/11+$\varepsilon$ ) , for any fixed $\varepsilon$ >0 , improving the previous best upper bound of O(nr log n) . Our algorithm simulates the sequence of collisions between edges and vertices during the shrinking process, using a technique of Eppstein for maintaining extrema of binary functions to reduce the problem of finding successive interactions to two dynamic range query problems: (1) maintain a changing set of triangles in R 3 and answer queries asking which triangle is first hit by a query ray, and (2) maintain a changing set of rays in R 3 and answer queries asking for the lowest intersection of any ray with a query triangle. We also exploit a novel characterization of the straight skeleton as a lower envelope of triangles in R 3 . The same time bounds apply to constructing non-self-intersecting offset curves with mitered or beveled corners, and similar methods extend to other problems of simulating collisions and other pairwise interactions among sets of moving objects.},

booktitle = {7th ICA Workshop on Generalisation and Multiple Representation},
year = {2004},
month = jul,
abstract = {In recent time a lot of research has been done towards the comprehensive administration of geographic data of different scales and thematic domains. A promising approach is the use of a Multiple Representation Database (MRDB) in which links between corresponding objects are explicitly modelled. The advantage of this approach is a limitation of redundancies and inconsistencies. It can be expected that this comprehensive administration of different data sets supports complex analysis and eases the updating process (Sester et al. 1998). Our aim is to build up a framework enabling the automatic update of features in an MRDB. We envision a system which is able to propagate information into the other representations in the database when a feature is added to an arbitrary level. To meet this demand algorithms are needed which are able to perform the generalisation of the added data considering the embedding context. The algorithms needed for generalisation depend on the relationships between objects in adjacent scale levels. The main relation is the aggregation, however, there are also more complex ones. Two of these cases are area collapses and geometry type changes. This also includes partial geometry type changes. The paper is organized as follows: after a review of related work, the relationships between objects in different scales are briefly analyzed in section 2. The main focus of the paper lies, however, in the presentation of a skeleton algorithm that can be applied to solve this task for the generalisation cases area collapse and geometry type changes from area to line. In this work the Straight Skeleton is used. The algorithm and its application to generalisation is presented in section 3. In section 4 first ideas are presented how this generalisation method can be used for the propagation of updates in MRDB. A summary concludes the paper.},

It relies on a structural representation of a street network using graph principles where vertices represent named streets and links represent street intersections. Based on this representation, so-called connectivity graph, centrality measures are introduced to qualify the status of each individual vertex within the graph. We show that these measures can be used for characterizing the structural properties of an urban street network, and for the selection of important streets. The proposed approach is validated by a case study applied to a middle-sized Swedish city.},

In automated generalization, the challenge is in deriving generalized forms of a road network, appropriate for the intended target scale and to achieve this with minimum intervention from the user. This paper presents a method for the detection and simplification of road junctions as part of that process. Road junctions within the network are identified using a combination of spatial clustering and graph theory. The junctions are simplified using a combination of contractions and restrictions of the graph. Consideration is given to ways in which attribute and cartometric information can be used both to modify the behavior of the algorithm, and to influence the choice of other generalization algorithms. This algorithm is considered to be part of a growing number of generalization algorithms that can be used to derive generalized products from single detailed database. The success and limitations are discussed and future developments are proposed.},

For many applications, the apparent ideal procedure is to represent lines and boundaries by means of polygons with minimum number of vertices and satisfying a given fit criterion. In this paper, an approximation algorithm is presented which uses an iterative method to produce polygons with a small---but not minimum---number of vertices that lie on the given curve. The maximum distance of the curve from the approximating polygon is chosen as the fit criterion. The results obtained justify the abandonment of the minimum-vertices criterion which is computationally much more expensive.},

abstract = {After decades of using only one map projection, the Polyconic, for its mapping program, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) now uses several of the more common projections for its published maps. For larger scale maps, including topographic quadrangles and the State Base Map Series, conformal projections such as the Transverse Mercator and the Lambert Conformal Conic are used. Equal-area and equidistant projections appear in the National Atlas. Other projections, such as the Miller Cylindrical and the Van der Grinten, are chosen occasionally for convenience, sometimes making use of existing base maps prepared by others. Some projections treat the Earth only as a sphere, others as either ellipsoid or sphere.

The USGS has also conceived and designed several new projections, including the Space Oblique Mercator, the first map projection designed to permit mapping of the Earth continuously from a satellite with low distortion. The mapping of extraterrestrial bodies has resulted in the use of standard projections in completely new settings. Several other projections which have not been used by the USGS are frequently of interest to the cartographic public.

With increased computerization, it is important to realize that rectangular coordinates for all these projections may be mathematically calculated with formulas which would have seemed too complicated in the past, but which now may be programmed routinely, especially if aided by numerical examples. A discussion of appearance, usage, and history is given together with both forward and inverse equations for each projection involved.},

This paper presents a brief review of the application of the principles in map generalization, and then examines their particular relevance to the generalization of road networks. It is shown how the `good continuation' grouping principle can serve as the basis for analyzing a road network into a set of linear elements, here termed `strokes'. Further analysis allows the strokes to be ordered, to reflect their relative importance in the network. The deletion of the elements according to this sequence provides a simple and effective method of generalizing (attenuating) the network. This technique has been implemented, as part of the `GenSystem' generalization software package developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing. The implementation is outlined, and the effectiveness of the technique demonstrated.},
