abstract = {A multiple representation database contains several geographic data sets defined at different resolutions covering the same area. Objects within the different datasets that represent the same real world entity are connected with bi-directional links. Multiple representation databases can be used to increase the efficiency of updating topographic data sets. Updates in the large-scale dataset can be generalised and propagated to the small-scale datasets automatically. In this paper a method for automated propagation of updates in a multiple representation database is presented. Currently the method is designed to handle updates of roads and buildings.
A difficult issue in research on cartographic generalisation is how to obtain and formalise the cartographers' knowledge in such a way that it can be used to develop an automated procedure. In this paper data mining methods are used to extract such knowledge from a multiple representation database. An unsupervised classification of the objects in the large- scale data set is performed using the ISODATA algorithm. For each class the probability that members of the class are represented in a certain way in the small-scale data set is calculated. This knowledge is used for the automated propagation of updates. The method is currently being tested on topographical data sets provided by the Swedish National Land Survey on a scale of 1:10 000, 1:50 000 and 1:100 000.},

abstract = {In cartography, computer graphics, pattern recognition, etc., we often encounter the problem of approximating a given finer piecewise linear curve by another coarser piecewise linear curve consisting of fewer line segments. In connection with this problem, a number of papers have been published, but it seems that the problem itself has not been well modelled from the standpoint of specific applications, nor has a nice algorithm, nice from the computational-geometric viewpoint, been proposed. In the present paper, we first consider (i) the problem of approximating a piecewise linear curve by another whose vertices are a subset of the vertices of the former, and show that an optimum solution of this problem can be found in a polynomial time. We also mention recent results on related problems by several researchers including the authors themselves. We then pose (ii) a problem of covering a sequence of n points by a minimum number of rectangles with a given width, and present an O(n long n)-time algorithm by making use of some fundamental established techniques in computational geometry. Furthermore, an O(mn(log n) 2)-time algorithm is presented for finding the minimum width w such that a sequence of n points can be covered by at most m rectangles with width w. Finally, (iii) several related problems are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the utilization of graph theory to aid in the subtle application of specific generalization techniques during map design. The visualization of space encapsulates the notion of context, the representation of the interdependence of salient variables and even that of aesthetics; many of the subtleties of the cartographic hand rely on a rich understanding of those relationships. It is argued that any equivalent automated system needs to have the same rich knowledge explicitly or implicitly stored with each feature. The consequences for database design from this perspective are very different from ones that require efficiency or cater to spatial query.
Generalization techniques are not applied wholesale to map objects. Their application varies both within each class of objects (such as all roads) and between different classes of objects (linear roads are not treated in the same way as linear rivers). The authors consider that the utilization of graph theory affords a means of capturing the context under which generalization techniques are selected and applied; the graph can be weighted to reflect the varying emphasis in the relationships between objects and sets of objects, as well as help select objects according to their relevance, context and proximity to salient features. Conventionally graph theory relies on being able to identify links between discrete objects. The links between objects need themselves to be generalizable. The paper looks at these problems and identifies some of the functional requirements of the database.},

title = {{Efficient Generalisation and Abstraction of Network Data Using Perceptual Grouping}},
booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on GeoComputation},
year = {2000},
language = {English},
abstract = {Spatial data generalisation or abstraction is a vital computational procedure in data presentation (notably in cartography) and in data integration. This paper considers the particular difficulties of the generalisation of road and river networks, outlining the approach developed at Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) which exploits the principles of perceptual organisation . Perceptual organization (or grouping) principles present a powerful set of analysis tools for spatial data, with applications in various fields. They are key to the human understanding of images and hence can direct us to the crucial aspects of spatial analysis.
By means of the perceptual grouping principle of `good continuation' the network can be analysed (i.e. broken down) into linear elements, which are non-branching chains of arcs. We term these linear elements `strokes'; this term is prompted by the idea of a curvilinear segment that can be drawn in one smooth movement and without a dramatic change in style. Unlike arcs, strokes may in theory contain any positive number of nodes, and may intersect each other or themselves. They are also computationally simple to derive, and can be applied in both road and river network analysis. Furthermore, the stroke-building algorithm is both robust enough to operate on incomplete or imperfect data, and can be easily constrained using additional information.

Further analysis allows the derived strokes to be ordered, to reflect their relative importance in the network. The deletion of the elements according to this sequence then provides a simple and effective method of generalising (attenuating) the network. In the case of hydrologic networks, the established method of generalisation on the basis of stream orders can be viewed as a special instance of this more general approach. We also note that when two sub-strokes are combined into a new stroke the attributes of the resulting stroke can be easily obtained from those of the component sub-strokes. This allows the analysis of a network to be derived from the analysis of component pieces - with concomitant advantages in efficiency and storage.

This perception-based approach to network generalisation has been implemented and evaluated at CCRS. The implementation is outlined, results presented, and the effectiveness of the techniques demonstrated on both road and river networks. The technique has been used to do the hydrology selection for a map covering Canada's three northern territories.},

Using the perceptual grouping principle of `good continuation', a network is decomposed into chains of network arcs, termed `strokes'. The network strokes are then automatically ranked according to derived measures. Deleting strokes from the network following this ranking sequence provides a simple but very effective means of generalizing (attenuating) the network.
