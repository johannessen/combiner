<title>de.thaw.thesis.comb</title><body>

<p>
The main Combiner package. <q>comb</q> is simply an abbreviation of <q>combiner</q> (at this point anyway).

<p>
The {@link de.thaw.thesis.comb.Combiner} class is the main class for this package.

<p>
Note that many public methods in this package use <code>assert</code> to check their parameters, resulting in {@link java.lang.AssertionError}s instead of {@link java.lang.RuntimeException}s being thrown. This is considered a bug which needs to be fixed in a later version of this package. Also note that these checks are not usually documented.

<p>
Also note that many parts of this package have not yet been optimised for speed and memory use. While most parts should be reasonably efficient even now, it's not difficult to find issues, e. g. excessive creation of <code>Vector</code> objects and their garbage collection.

<p>
<strong><em>further documentation is forthcoming</em></strong>
