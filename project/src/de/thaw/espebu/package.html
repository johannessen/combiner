<title>de.thaw.espebu</title><body>

<p>
Espebu served as a test bed for spatial data handling in Java. It is not designed to be fully controllable from the command line. Switching modules / trying out different parts of this package requires changing the source code of the main class {@link de.thaw.espebu.Espebu} and recompiling.

<p>
Features include:
<ul>
<li>
reading JTS {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.LineString}s from Well-Known Text
<li>
<del>reading {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.LineString}s from Spatialite databases</del>
<li>
reading {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.LineString}s from ESRI Shapefiles and (re)projecting them
<li>
writing {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Geometry}s to ESRI Shapefiles
<li>
splitting {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.LineString}s such that there remain no line fragments with start- and endpoints which are closer to another passing line fragment than to a start- or endpoint of that same line fragment;<br>
in other words: splitting such that parallel lines A and B would be split into fragments (A1, A2, A3, …; B1, B2, B3, …) such that the fragments A1 and B1 have approximately the same length and are adjacent to each other, as are (A2 and B2), (A3 and B3) etc.
<li>
analysing a collection of {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.LineString}s by parallelisms and determine which ones of the other {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.LineString}s in the same collection (if any) are geometrically parallel (attributes are not taken into account)
<li>
merging continuing {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.LineString}s into a single {@link com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.LineString} in cases where there is no geometric ambiguity (attributes are not taken into account)
</ul>

<p>
The algorithms in this package are not designed to be particularly cheap on either time or memory. In fact, it's quite easy to point out a number of gross inefficiencies that make their naïve approach seem improbable as a useable real-world solution. Neither this package nor the algorithms contained in it are meant to be re-used later on, yet they might be useful as a fall-back or to provide future solutions with means for comparison.

<p>
Note that some of the existing code in this package is non-functional (though everything should compile all right). This notably includes the {@link de.thaw.espebu.SpatialiteReader} class.
