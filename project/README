Testbed
=======

(1)
Install dependency:
- get GeoTools 8.5 (no other versions tested), <http://www.geotools.org/>
- unpack into lib
- search for all gt-epsg-*.jar
- delete all of those but one (for example, keep gt-epsg-hsql-8.5.jar)

The class path consists of the lib directory and any _immediate_ subdirectories.

(2)
Install test dataset:
- execute data/prepare-testdata.sh
- see source code for details!

(3)
Build and run:
$ run-testbed.sh

(Ant needs the current working directory set to project/ !)


Notes:
- "'on the fly' CRS transformation" needs to be enabled in QGIS's Project Properties, otherwise QGIS will ignore any CRS specified in the data.
